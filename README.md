# NHL-Drafting-Model

Completed in partnership with Stephanie DiNunzio and Kevin Hu.

The use of analytics and data has become a key component to the National Hockey League (NHL) player 
evaluation landscape. While there has been an extensive amount of investment and research into the 
development of various NHL player models, the same developments have not been made to evaluate 
junior level talent. This project focuses on the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence and Machine 
Learning to help evaluate prospects in one of the NHLâ€™s main junior pipelines: the Canadian Hockey 
League (CHL). Dataset sourced from pick224.com.
